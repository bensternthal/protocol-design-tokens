# Protocol Gradients (WIP)

The standard set of gradients for projects that want to harmonize with Mozillaâ€™s new Protocol design language.

## Formatting
- type (string) - either linear or radial
- angle (value) - the direction of the gradient defined by the angle.
- colors (string) - color stops in sequential order

```
{
  "name": "greyscale",
  "type": "linear",
  "angle": 90,
  "colors": [
    "#000000",
    "#FFFFFF"
  ]
}
```
